This repository demonstrates some uncommon bugs that can occur when using the CSS `calc()` function. The `bug.css` file contains examples of code that can lead to unexpected results. The `bugSolution.css` file provides corrected versions of the code.  The issues highlighted include missing spaces around operators in calculations, unit mismatches, and the difficulties of deeply nested `calc()` expressions. Understanding these edge cases is crucial for writing robust and predictable CSS.
