The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there are some cases that can lead to unexpected results due to operator precedence or missing spaces. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly but `width:calc(100%-10px);` might not work as expected because of missing spaces around the minus operator. The same holds true for other operators like +, *, /. Another issue can be caused by using `calc()` with units that don't align. For instance, trying to subtract pixels from percentages without proper consideration of the context might produce incorrect results. Also, nesting `calc()` too deeply can make the code difficult to read and debug, which can lead to subtle bugs that are not easy to detect.
